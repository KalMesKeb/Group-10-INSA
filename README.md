## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is to define and document the functional and non-functional requirements for a job website that connects tutors and students through psychometric-based matching methodologies. This document serves as a formal agreement between stakeholdersâ€”including project sponsors, developers, quality assurance teams, and end usersâ€”on the systemâ€™s intended capabilities, performance criteria, and constraints.

The SRS ensures that all participants share a common understanding of the platformâ€™s objectives:

- To enable students to find suitable tutors not only based on subject expertise but also on compatibility profiles derived from psychometric assessments.
- To assist tutors in reaching students whose learning styles, motivations, and personality traits align with their teaching methods.
- To provide an accurate, transparent, and user-friendly digital marketplace that improves learning outcomes through scientifically guided matchmaking.

This document will be used throughout the systemâ€™s lifecycle for planning, design, development, validation, verification, and maintenance, in accordance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 requirements engineering best practices.

### 1.2 Scope
The system to be developed is an online job-matching platform that connects tutors and students by combining conventional search criteria (such as subject, location, and availability) with advanced psychometric matching methodologies. The platformâ€™s core objective is to enhance educational outcomes by pairing students with tutors whose teaching approaches, communication styles, and personality traits are optimally aligned with the studentsâ€™ learning styles, motivations, and cognitive profiles.

Key functionalities include:

- **User Registration & Profiling** â€“ Secure account creation for students and tutors, including personal information, subject areas, qualifications, and psychometric assessment results.
- **Psychometric Assessments** â€“ Standardized tests to evaluate personality traits, cognitive preferences, and learning/teaching styles.
- **Intelligent Matching Algorithm** â€“ Automated recommendation engine that uses psychometric compatibility scores alongside traditional filters to suggest optimal tutorâ€“student pairings.
- **Search & Browse** â€“ Manual search and filtering for users who prefer self-selection, with compatibility scores displayed.
- **Communication Tools** â€“ In-platform messaging and scheduling features to arrange lessons and share materials.
- **Payment & Review System** â€“ Secure payment processing, lesson tracking, and post-session feedback to ensure quality assurance.

The platform will be accessible via web browsers on desktop and mobile devices, with future scalability to a dedicated mobile application. The system will operate in compliance with relevant data protection regulations, ensuring user privacy and the secure handling of psychometric and personal data.

This scope covers the design, development, deployment, and maintenance of the platform, excluding the creation of third-party psychometric tests and any offline tutoring activities.
